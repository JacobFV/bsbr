# BSBR: Block Sparse Attention with Block Retrieval

A PyTorch implementation of Block Sparse Attention with Block Retrieval (BSBR), a novel attention mechanism for efficient processing of long sequences.

## Features

- Efficient processing of long sequences by combining:
  - Standard attention within chunks
  - Block retrieval between chunks
- Configurable chunk size
- Optional state compression
- Memory efficient with linear complexity in sequence length

## Implemented Transformer Architectures

The repository includes implementations of several efficient transformer architectures:

1. **BSBR (Block Sparse with Block Retrieval)**: Our core implementation with chunk-based attention and efficient block retrieval
2. **Standard Transformer**: The classic self-attention mechanism with O(n²) complexity
3. **Linear Transformer**: Removes softmax for O(n) complexity using associative property of matrix multiplication
4. **DeltaNet**: Enhanced Linear Transformer with a removal component for better memory management
5. **Sliding Window Transformer**: Restricts attention to a fixed window size for O(n·w) complexity
6. **Hopfield Network**: Memory-based attention inspired by modern Hopfield Networks
7. **GAU (Gated Attention Unit)**: Chunk-based parallel attention with gating mechanisms

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bsbr.git
cd bsbr

# Install the core package
pip install -e .

# Install with extras for evaluations and research
pip install -e ".[extras]"
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the BSBR model:

```python
import torch
from bsbr import BSBRModel

# Model configuration
model = BSBRModel(
    vocab_size=10000,
    hidden_dim=512,
    num_layers=4,
    num_heads=8,
    chunk_size=128,
    ff_dim=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    compression_factor=4  # Optional compression
)

# Input data
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 10000, (2, 256))
attention_mask = torch.ones(2, 256)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
```

## Components

### Core Model

- **BSBRAttention**: The core attention mechanism
- **BSBRLayer**: A complete transformer layer with BSBR attention and feed-forward network
- **BSBRModel**: A full model with embedding, multiple BSBR layers, and normalization

### Additional Models (Extras)

For evaluation and research purposes, we also include several alternative attention architectures:

- **Standard Transformer**: Classic transformer with full attention (baseline)
- **Linear Transformer**: Linear complexity transformer using a reformulated attention mechanism
- **DeltaNet**: Enhanced linear transformer with a removal component 
- **Sliding Window Transformer**: Efficient attention with a fixed context window
- **Hopfield Network**: Associative memory-based attention for pattern completion
- **GAU**: Gated Attention Unit with chunk-based parallelism

These additional models are available in the `bsbr_extras` package and can be installed with the `extras` option.

## Evaluation

The repository includes tools to evaluate and compare different architectures:

```bash
# Run comparison of all models
python evals/compare_models.py --seq_lengths 64 128 256 512 1024

# Compare specific models
python evals/compare_models.py --models BSBR Linear Hopfield GAU

# Analyze results
python evals/analyze_results.py --use_example_data
```

Evaluations include:
- Inference time
- Memory usage
- Parameter counts
- Computational complexity analysis

## Algorithm

BSBR works by combining two types of attention:

1. **Within-chunk attention**: Standard attention with softmax
   ```
   softmax(QK^T · M_in)V
   ```

2. **Between-chunk attention**: Block retrieval using meta queries and keys
   ```
   Q ⊙ softmax(RH^T · M_out)F
   ```

Where:
- Q, K, V: Query, Key, Value matrices
- R, H: Meta queries and keys for chunk-level attention
- F: State vectors (flattened K^T·V for each chunk)
- M_in: Block diagonal mask
- M_out: Causal mask for chunk-level attention
